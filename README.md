xdb-digitalbits-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a
[DigitalBits Frontier server](https://github.com/xdbfoundation/go/tree/master/services/frontier).
It is used for building DigitalBits apps either on Node.js or in the browser.

It provides:

- a networking layer API for Frontier endpoints.
- facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with a
  DigitalBits Frontier instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network
  history.

### xdb-digitalbits-sdk vs xdb-digitalbits-base

xdb-digitalbits-sdk is a high-level library that serves as client-side API for Frontier.
[xdb-digitalbits-base](https://github.com/xdbfoundation/xdb-digitalbits-base) is lower-level
library for creating DigitalBits primitive constructs via XDR helpers and wrappers.

**Most people will want digitalbits-sdk instead of digitalbits-base.** You should only
use digitalbits-base if you know what you're doing!

If you add `digitalbits-sdk` to a project, **do not add `digitalbits-base`!** Mis-matching
versions could cause weird, hard-to-find bugs. `digitalbits-sdk` automatically
installs `digitalbits-base` and exposes all of its exports in case you need them.

> **Important!** The Node.js version of the `digitalbits-base` (`digitalbits-sdk` dependency) package
> uses the [`sodium-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium-native) package as
> an [optional dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#optionaldependencies). `sodium-native` is
> a low level binding to [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium),
> (an implementation of [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) signatures).
> If installation of `sodium-native` fails, or it is unavailable, `digitalbits-base` (and `digitalbits-sdk`) will
> fallback to using the [`tweetnacl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweetnacl) package implementation.
>
> If you are using `digitalbits-sdk`/`digitalbits-base` in a browser you can ignore
> this. However, for production backend deployments you should be
> using `sodium-native`. If `sodium-native` is successfully installed and working the
> `DigitalBitsSdk.FastSigning` variable will return `true`.

## Quick start

Using npm to include xdb-digitalbits-sdk in your own project:

```shell
npm install --save @digitalbits-blockchain/xdb-digitalbits-sdk
```

## Install

### To use as a module in a Node.js project

1. Install it using npm:

```shell
npm install --save @digitalbits-blockchain/xdb-digitalbits-sdk
```

2. require/import it in your JavaScript:

```js
var DigitalBitsSdk = require('@digitalbits-blockchain/xdb-digitalbits-sdk');
```

### To self host for use in the browser

1. Install it using [bower](http://bower.io):

```shell
bower install @digitalbits-blockchain/xdb-digitalbits-sdk
```

2. Include it in the browser:

```html
<script src="./bower_components/xdb-digitalbits-sdk/xdb-digitalbits-sdk.js"></script>
<script>
  console.log(DigitalBitsSdk);
</script>
```

If you don't want to use or install Bower, you can copy built JS files from the
[bower-xdb-digitalbits-sdk repo](https://github.com/xdbfoundation/bower-xdb-digitalbits-sdk).

### To use the [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/digitalbits-sdk) hosted script in the browser

1. Instruct the browser to fetch the library from
   [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/digitalbits-sdk), a 3rd party service that
   hosts js libraries:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/digitalbits-sdk/{version}/digitalbits-sdk.js"></script>
<script>
  console.log(DigitalBitsSdk);
</script>
```

Note that this method relies using a third party to host the JS library. This
may not be entirely secure.

Make sure that you are using the latest version number. They can be found on the
[releases page in Github](https://github.com/xdbfoundation/xdb-digitalbits-sdk/releases).

### To develop and test xdb-digitalbits-sdk itself

1. Clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xdbfoundation/xdb-digitalbits-sdk.git
```

2. Install dependencies inside xdb-digitalbits-sdk folder:

```shell
cd xdb-digitalbits-sdk
npm install
```

3. Install Node 14

Because we support the latest maintenance version of Node, please install and develop on Node 14 so you don't get surprised when your code works locally but breaks in CI.

Here's how to install `nvm` if you haven't: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

```shell
nvm install

# if you've never installed 14 before you'll want to re-install yarn
npm install -g yarn
```

If you work on several projects that use different Node versions, you might it
helpful to install this automatic version manager:
https://github.com/wbyoung/avn

4. Observe the project's code style

While you're making changes, make sure to run the linter-watcher to catch any
   linting errors (in addition to making sure your text editor supports ESLint)

```shell
node_modules/.bin/gulp watch
````

### How to use with React-Native

1. Add the following postinstall script:
```
yarn rn-nodeify --install url,events,https,http,util,stream,crypto,vm,buffer --hack --yarn
```
2. `yarn add -D rn-nodeify`
3. Uncomment `require('crypto')` on shim.js
4. `react-native link react-native-randombytes`
5. Create file `rn-cli.config.js`
```
module.exports = {
  resolver: {
    extraNodeModules: require("node-libs-react-native"),
  },
};
```
6. Add `import "./shim";` to the top of `index.js`
7. `yarn add digitalbits-sdk`

There is also a [sample](https://github.com/fnando/rn-digitalbits-sdk-sample) that you can follow.

#### Using in an Expo managed workflow

1. Add the following postinstall script:
```
yarn rn-nodeify --install process,url,events,https,http,util,stream,crypto,vm,buffer --hack --yarn
```
2. `yarn add -D rn-nodeify`
3. Add `import "./shim";` to the your app's entry point (by default `./App.js`)
4. `yarn add digitalbits-sdk`
5. `expo install expo-random`

At this point, the digitalbits SDK will work, except that `DigitalBitsSdk.Keypair.random()` will throw an error. So to work around this you can create your own method to generate a random keypair like this:

```javascript
import * as Random from 'expo-random';
import DigitalBitsSdk from 'xdb-digitalbits-sdk';

const generateRandomKeypair = () => {
  const randomBytes = Random.getRandomBytes(32);

  return DigitalBitsSdk.Keypair.fromRawEd25519Seed(Buffer.from(randomBytes));
};
```
